# What is R? {#what-is-R}

## What is R?

**R** 

- is an open-source statistical programming language. 
- available for most operating systems
- helps users analyze, visualize, and model data—from simple summaries to complex data analysis
- is extremely popular in statistics and data science, see [this article](http://r4stats.com/articles/popularity/)
- includes thousands of packages (add-ons) that can be used for 
specialized tasks without a deep understanding of the language and programming skills
- allows for extensive programming, making it also suitable for advanced or case-specific applications of statistical methods

The combination of the latter two aspects sets **R** apart and makes it useful for everything ranging from standard 'basic' statistical analysis to the development of new methods.

The homepage of **R** is [www.r-project.org](www.r-project.org) from which you can install **R** and access manuals that provide detailed information about installing and using **R**.


# Installing R {#install-R}

## R Installation
To install **R**, go to the Comprehensive R Archive Network [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/). At the time of writing, it looks as follows:

![](figures/website-R-1.png)


## R Installation
To download, for instance, **R** for Windows, you arrive at the following page:

![](figures/website-R-2.png)

## R Installation
Now download the latest version of **R** (version 4.5.0 at the time of writing):

![](figures/website-R-3.png)

## R Installation
Start the download process:

![](figures/download-R-1.png)

## R Installation
Continue the download process:

![](figures/download-R-2.png)

## R Installation
Download completed:

![](figures/download-R-3.png)

# First Steps in R {#open-R}

## Opening R

Open **R**, you should see the following:

![](figures/open-R-1.png)

## Opening R

The program window provides some basic information on **R** and the installed version.  

Check your version of **R**!

![](figures/open-R-2.png)

## R Console

The **R** Console can be used to directly give in commands and display output:

![](figures/R-console-1.png)

## R Prompt

Under the default information, you can see the **R** prompt, through which **R** indicates that it is ready to execute a new command.

![](figures/R-console-2.png)

## Executing your first command

Start by using **R** as a simple calculator, try to enter after the **R** prompt:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
2+3
```
and hit <em>enter</em>.

You will see that **R** directly returns the output in the **R** console next to the '[1]': 
```{r}
2+3
```

If you want to re-execute your previous command, use the arrow key <em>↑</em>. To make changes to a command, you can use the <em>←, →</em> arrows and re-execute. To move to the next command, use the  <em>↓</em> arrow.

Finally, when **R** receives an incomplete expression such as 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
2+
```
**R** will return the <em>+</em> symbol, thereby letting you know that you forgot to type something. You can either complete the command and then hit <em>enter</em> or exit the incomplete command via the <em>esc</em> button.


## Exercise 1.1

Enter the following expressions, one by one, in **R** and hit <em>enter</em> to see how **R** evaluates them:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
2 + 3*4

(2 + 3)*4

(2 + 3*4

sqrt(4)

pi
```

## From R to Rstudio

After taking your first steps in **R**, you might not be impressed by the design of the user interface and the way the software is used. 

There are various user interfaces that work on top of plain **R** to make it more user friendly. A very popular one is **RStudio**.


# What is RStudio? {#what-is-RStudio}

## What is RStudio?

**RStudio**

- is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for **R**

- is a user-friendly interface for writing and running **R** code

- makes it easier to write code, analyze data, create visuals, access documentation and manage projects

Its homepage is [https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

# Installing RStudio {#install-RStudio}

## RStudio Installation

To download **RStudio**, go to its [download](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) page. At the time of writing, it looks as follows:

![](figures/website-RStudio-1.png)

## RStudio Installation
Start the download process:

![](figures/download-RStudio-1.png)

# First Steps in RStudio {#open-RStudio}


## Opening RStudio

Open **RStudio**, you should see the following:

![](figures/open-RStudio-1.png)

## Opening RStudio

You will recognize the **R** Console and see that **RStudio** is ready to receive input:

![](figures/open-RStudio-2.png)


## Exercise 1.2

Re-execute the commands you executed before in **R** now in the **R** Console of **RStudio**:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
2 + 3*4

(2 + 3)*4

(2 + 3*4

sqrt(4)

pi
```

The console in **RStudio** behaves exactly the same as the plain **R** window!

## Structure in RStudio

But **RStudio** has much more to offer than plain **R**!

**RStudio** (unlike **R**) is structured in different windows. You should currently see 3 windows:

- Left: **R** console
- Top right: Display of objects in the global environment
- Bottom right: Files, plots, packages, help, etc.

## RStudio Windows

The 3 main windows (aka panes) in **RStudio**:

![](figures/open-RStudio-3.png)

## RStudio Menu Bar

**RStudio** also has a Menu bar at the top:

![](figures/open-RStudio-4.png)

The usefulness of these windows and menu bar in **RStudio** will become clear throughout this training.


## Exercise 1.3
 
Explore the following quick tricks that the console in **RStudio** offers. After the prompt:

- press the <em>ctrl</em> button on Windows, or the <em>command</em> on Mac together with the arrow key <em>↑</em>. What do you see?

It should give you a list of all previously executed commands. You can then use the <em>↑</em> and <em>↓</em> arrow keys to directly move to a certain command to repeat or correct it. 

- start to write sq and then hit the tabulator (tab) key <em>⇆</em>
right after without an additional space. What do you see?

It should present you with a list of suggested commands together with a short description. You can then use the <em>↑</em> and <em>↓</em> arrow keys to navigate through them. Which one is the relevant one to compute the square root of a number? Choose the appropriate function, then hit <em>enter</em> to compute the square root of 100. 

## Need for R Scripts
Suppose you want to continue your work tomorrow. If you would now close **RStudio**, all of your work would be gone!

To avoid this problem, we will not give commands directly in the **R** console, but save them in an **R** Script.


# R Script {#R-script}

## What is an R Script?

While many simple calculations can be done using the command line, as soon as things get more complicated, scripts should be used.

An **R** Script

- is a plain text file that contains a collection of **R** commands

- is written in such a form to perform commands in a step by step fashion

- contains all commands including those for importing data, analyzing data, visualizing data or other tasks

- can be saved as a .R file 

- allows you to automate and reproduce your work, allowing you to run the same analysis without having to redo each step manually again

- makes your work organized, shareable and transparent!


## Creating an R Script

Creating an **R** Script is easy. 

Using the menu bar, go to <em>File</em>, <em>New File</em>, <em>R Script</em>:

![](figures/R-script-1.png)

Alternatively, you could have used the shortcut <em>ctrl+shift+N</em> on Windows or <em>command+shift+N</em> on Mac.

## Structure in RStudio

RStudio now displays 4 windows, with the **R** Script currently displayed in the top left:

![](figures/R-script-2.png)

## R Script

Currently the **R** Script is Untitled, we should give it a name. 

![](figures/R-script-3.png)

## Exercise 1.4

Give your R Script a name and save it. Go to <em>File</em>, <em>Save As...</em>:

![](figures/R-script-4.png)

## R Working Directory

Before we start working in our R Script, let us first set the working directory in **R**.

The working directory is the location on your computer where **R** will read and save files. Go to <em>Session</em>, <em>Set Working Directory</em>. Two convenient options are:  

- <em>Choose Directory...</em>: Choose the directory yourself

- <em>To Source File Location</em>: Set the working directory to the directory where your **R** Script (the source file) is saved

![](figures/R-script-5.png)



## R Working Directory

Select the option to set the working directory to the source file location. You will see that a command automatically pops up in the R console, something like:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd("C:/Rtraining")
```

You can use this command directly next time. Mind the usage of the  <em>/</em> when specifying the path of your working directory!


You can also include comment lines in your **R** script. These start with the symbol <em>#</em> and allow you to document your code. For instance:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Setting my working directory
setwd("C:/Rtraining")
```


## Exercise 1.5
Copy some of the commands you previously executed into your **R** Script. 

Execute a specific line

-  by pressing the <em>Run</em> button to execute the line on which your cursor is currently located

- by using <em>ctrl+enter</em> on Windows or <em>command+enter</em>  on Mac to execute the line on which your cursor is currently located

![](figures/R-script-6.png)

You can execute multiple lines by highlighting them all and doing one of the above. Try this.



## Exercise 1.6
You can adjust the sizes and positioning of the windows (panes) according to your liking. 

Go to <em>Tools</em>, <em>Global Options...</em> and then select <em>Pane Layout</em> from which you can adjust the positioning of each of the 4 panes by selecting them from the drop-down menus

![](figures/R-script-7.png)

Experiment with a different positioning and re-adjust  according to your liking.

# R Package Management System {#R-packages}

## R Package Management System

Until now, we have  explored some basic functionality in **R**. But much of the functionality of **R** is extended by its big and active community.

These extensions are called **R** packages

## What are R packages?

**R** packages

- are constantly developed and adjusted by the large user community making many state-of-the-art methods quickly available

- can be installed for just about everything you want to do in statistics and data science

- offer pre-defined functions which makes it possible to use **R** without a deep understanding of the language and programming skills.


## Overview of R packages

The standard distribution of **R** comes already with a number of packages. 

A list of the currently installed packages can be obtained from the <em>Packages</em> window in the bottom right window below

![](figures/R-package-1.png)

You can install new packages depending on your needs. We will explore R packages in the upcoming sessions!
