At the time of writing, it looks as follows:\n\n![](figures/website-R-1.png)\n\n\n## R Installation\nTo download, for instance, **R** for Windows, you arrive at the following page:\n\n![](figures/website-R-2.png)\n\n## R Installation\nNow download the latest version of **R** (version 4.5.0 at the time of writing):\n\n![](figures/website-R-3.png)\n\n## R Installation\nStart the download process:\n\n![](figures/download-R-1.png)\n\n## R Installation\nContinue the download process:\n\n![](figures/download-R-2.png)\n\n## R Installation\nDownload completed:\n\n![](figures/download-R-3.png)\n\n# First Steps in R {#open-R}\n\n## Opening R\n\nOpen **R**, you should see the following:\n\n![](figures/open-R-1.png)\n\n## Opening R\n\nThe program window provides some basic information on **R** and the installed version.  \n\nCheck your version of **R**!\n\n![](figures/open-R-2.png)\n\n## R Console\n\nThe **R** Console can be used to directly give in commands and display output:\n\n![](figures/R-console-1.png)\n\n## R Prompt\n\nUnder the default information, you can see the **R** prompt, through which **R** indicates that it is ready to execute a new command.\n\n![](figures/R-console-2.png)\n\n## Executing your first command\n\nStart by using **R** as a simple calculator, try to enter after the **R** prompt:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n2+3\n```\n:::\n\n\nand hit <em>enter</em>.\n\nYou will see that **R** directly returns the output in the **R** console next to the '[1]': \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n2+3\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 5\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nIf you want to re-execute your previous command, use the arrow key <em>↑</em>. To make changes to a command, you can use the <em>←, →</em> arrows and re-execute. To move to the next command, use the  <em>↓</em> arrow.\n\nFinally, when **R** receives an incomplete expression such as \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n2+\n```\n:::\n\n\n**R** will return the <em>+</em> symbol, thereby letting you know that you forgot to type something. You can either complete the command and then hit <em>enter</em> or exit the incomplete command via the <em>esc</em> button.\n\n\n## Exercise 1.1\n\nEnter the following expressions, one by one, in **R** and hit <em>enter</em> to see how **R** evaluates them:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n2 + 3*4\n\n(2 + 3)*4\n\n(2 + 3*4\n\nsqrt(4)\n\npi\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## From R to Rstudio\n\nAfter taking your first steps in **R**, you might not be impressed by the design of the user interface and the way the software is used. \n\nThere are various user interfaces that work on top of plain **R** to make it more user friendly. A very popular one is **RStudio**.\n\n\n# What is RStudio? {#what-is-RStudio}\n\n## What is RStudio?\n\n**RStudio**\n\n- is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for **R**\n\n- is a user-friendly interface for writing and running **R** code\n\n- makes it easier to write code, analyze data, create visuals, access documentation and manage projects\n\nIts homepage is [https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)\n\n# Installing RStudio {#install-RStudio}\n\n## RStudio Installation\n\nTo download **RStudio**, go to its [download](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) page. At the time of writing, it looks as follows:\n\n![](figures/website-RStudio-1.png)\n\n## RStudio Installation\nStart the download process:\n\n![](figures/download-RStudio-1.png)\n\n# First Steps in RStudio {#open-RStudio}\n\n\n## Opening RStudio\n\nOpen **RStudio**, you should see the following:\n\n![](figures/open-RStudio-1.png)\n\n## Opening RStudio\n\nYou will recognize the **R** Console and see that **RStudio** is ready to receive input:\n\n![](figures/open-RStudio-2.png)\n\n\n## Exercise 1.2\n\nRe-execute the commands you executed before in **R** now in the **R** Console of **RStudio**:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n2 + 3*4\n\n(2 + 3)*4\n\n(2 + 3*4\n\nsqrt(4)\n\npi\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThe console in **RStudio** behaves exactly the same as the plain **R** window!\n\n## Structure in RStudio\n\nBut **RStudio** has much more to offer than plain **R**!\n\n**RStudio** (unlike **R**) is structured in different windows. You should currently see 3 windows:\n\n- Left: **R** console\n- Top right: Display of objects in the global environment\n- Bottom right: Files, plots, packages, help, etc.\n\n## RStudio Windows\n\nThe 3 main windows (aka panes) in **RStudio**:\n\n![](figures/open-RStudio-3.png)\n\n## RStudio Menu Bar\n\n**RStudio** also has a Menu bar at the top:\n\n![](figures/open-RStudio-4.png)\n\nThe usefulness of these windows and menu bar in **RStudio** will become clear throughout this training.\n\n\n## Exercise 1.3\n \nExplore the following quick tricks that the console in **RStudio** offers. After the prompt:\n\n- press the <em>ctrl</em> button on Windows, or the <em>command</em> on Mac together with the arrow key <em>↑</em>. What do you see?\n\nIt should give you a list of all previously executed commands. You can then use the <em>↑</em> and <em>↓</em> arrow keys to directly move to a certain command to repeat or correct it. \n\n- start to write sq and then hit the tabulator (tab) key <em>⇆</em>\nright after without an additional space. What do you see?\n\nIt should present you with a list of suggested commands together with a short description. You can then use the <em>↑</em> and <em>↓</em> arrow keys to navigate through them. Which one is the relevant one to compute the square root of a number? Choose the appropriate function, then hit <em>enter</em> to compute the square root of 100. \n\n## Need for R Scripts\nSuppose you want to continue your work tomorrow. If you would now close **RStudio**, all of your work would be gone!\n\nTo avoid this problem, we will not give commands directly in the **R** console, but save them in an **R** Script.\n\n\n# R Script {#R-script}\n\n## What is an R Script?\n\nWhile many simple calculations can be done using the command line, as soon as things get more complicated, scripts should be used.\n\nAn **R** Script\n\n- is a plain text file that contains a collection of **R** commands\n\n- is written in such a form to perform commands in a step by step fashion\n\n- contains all commands including those for importing data, analyzing data, visualizing data or other tasks\n\n- can be saved as a .R file \n\n- allows you to automate and reproduce your work, allowing you to run the same analysis without having to redo each step manually again\n\n- makes your work organized, shareable and transparent!\n\n\n## Creating an R Script\n\nCreating an **R** Script is easy. \n\nUsing the menu bar, go to <em>File</em>, <em>New File</em>, <em>R Script</em>:\n\n![](figures/R-script-1.png)\n\nAlternatively, you could have used the shortcut <em>ctrl+shift+N</em> on Windows or <em>command+shift+N</em> on Mac.\n\n## Structure in RStudio\n\nRStudio now displays 4 windows, with the **R** Script currently displayed in the top left:\n\n![](figures/R-script-2.png)\n\n## R Script\n\nCurrently the **R** Script is Untitled, we should give it a name. \n\n![](figures/R-script-3.png)\n\n## Exercise 1.4\n\nGive your R Script a name and save it. Go to <em>File</em>, <em>Save As...</em>:\n\n![](figures/R-script-4.png)\n\n## R Working Directory\n\nBefore we start working in our R Script, let us first set the working directory in **R**.\n\nThe working directory is the location on your computer where **R** will read and save files. Go to <em>Session</em>, <em>Set Working Directory</em>. Two convenient options are:  \n\n- <em>Choose Directory...</em>: Choose the directory yourself\n\n- <em>To Source File Location</em>: Set the working directory to the directory where your **R** Script (the source file) is saved\n\n![](figures/R-script-5.png)\n\n\n\n## R Working Directory\n\nSelect the option to set the working directory to the source file location. You will see that a command automatically pops up in the R console, something like:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsetwd(\"C:/Rtraining\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nYou can use this command directly next time. Mind the usage of the  <em>/</em> when specifying the path of your working directory!\n\n\nYou can also include comment lines in your **R** script. These start with the symbol <em>#</em> and allow you to document your code. For instance:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Setting my working directory\nsetwd(\"C:/Rtraining\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Exercise 1.5\nCopy some of the commands you previously executed into your **R** Script. \n\nExecute a specific line\n\n-  by pressing the <em>Run</em> button to execute the line on which your cursor is currently located\n\n- by using <em>ctrl+enter</em> on Windows or <em>command+enter</em>  on Mac to execute the line on which your cursor is currently located\n\n![](figures/R-script-6.png)\n\nYou can execute multiple lines by highlighting them all and doing one of the above. Try this.\n\n\n\n## Exercise 1.6\nYou can adjust the sizes and positioning of the windows (panes) according to your liking. \n\nGo to <em>Tools</em>, <em>Global Options...</em> and then select <em>Pane Layout</em> from which you can adjust the positioning of each of the 4 panes by selecting them from the drop-down menus\n\n![](figures/R-script-7.png)\n\nExperiment with a different positioning and re-adjust  according to your liking.\n\n# R Package Management System {#R-packages}\n\n## R Package Management System\n\nUntil now, we have  explored some basic functionality in **R**. But much of the functionality of **R** is extended by its big and active community.\n\nThese extensions are called **R** packages\n\n## What are R packages?\n\n**R** packages\n\n- are constantly developed and adjusted by the large user community making many state-of-the-art methods quickly available\n\n- can be installed for just about everything you want to do in statistics and data science\n\n- offer pre-defined functions which makes it possible to use **R** without a deep understanding of the language and programming skills.\n\n\n## Overview of R packages\n\nThe standard distribution of **R** comes already with a number of packages. \n\nA list of the currently installed packages can be obtained from the <em>Packages</em> window in the bottom right window below\n\n![](figures/R-package-1.png)\n\nYou can install new packages depending on your needs. We will explore R packages in the upcoming sessions!\n\n\n\n",
