# Objects {#objects}

## Objects
- In R, **everything is an object**.
- Objects have a name that is assigned with `<-` (recommended) or `=`.
- Names have to start with a letter and include only letters,   numbers, and characters such as “.” and “_”.
- R is  **case sensitive:** $\Rightarrow Name\neq name$!

- Objects can store vectors, matrices, lists, data frames, functions...

```{r}
# generate object x (no output):
x <- 5
# display log(x)
log(x)

```
```{r, error=TRUE}
# object X is not defined => error message 
X
```

# Vectors {#vectors}

- Vectors can store multiple types of information (e.g., numbers or "characters").
- To define a 3-dimensional vector named "vec", use `vec<- c(value1,value2,value3)`.
- Operators and functions can be applied to vectors, which means they are applied to **each of the elements individually**.
```{r, eval=TRUE}
# define vector named 'vec'
vec<-c(1,2,3)
# take the square root of 'vec' and store the result in 'sqrt_vec'
sqrt_vec=sqrt(vec)
# display sqrt_vec
print(sqrt_vec)
```

## Vectors - some helpful shortcuts
- R has built-in functions that generate sequences (useful for loops or plots, among other things). 
- We can also repeat elements using `rep()`.
```{r, eval=TRUE}
# generate sequence 5,6,...,10
5:10
# generate sequence from 1 to 10 in steps of 0.5
seq(from=1,to=5,by=0.5)
#generate 4-dimensional vector of ones
rep(1,4)
```
## Order matters!
- **Be aware of the order of operations!**
- compare the following:
```{r, eval=TRUE}
1+2:3^2 # '^2' evaluated before ':', only then '+1' is evaluated
1+2:3*4 # first ':', then '*4', then '+1'
# use brackets to avoid confusion or mistakes
(1+2):(3*4)
```
## Summarizing vectors
- R has built-in functions to summarize the information stored in vectors.
- Remark: R is very good at generating random numbers!
```{r, eval=TRUE}
# Example: generate 100 random draws from a normal distribution with mean 1
# and standard deviation 2
norm.vec=rnorm(n=100,mean=1,sd=2)
# get mean 
mean(norm.vec)
# get standard deviation 
sd(norm.vec)
# get maximum
max(norm.vec)

```

## logical operators

- logical operators can be either `TRUE` or `FALSE`.
- Extremely useful for conditional statements, e.g. `if(condition is TRUE){do this}else{do that}`.
- We can check if two objects are equal by `==`, different by `!=` or compare them with `<` and `>`.
- We can combine logical statements with "AND" `&` and "OR" `|`
```{r, eval=TRUE}
# define  objects 
obj1<-1
obj2<-2
obj3<-1 # same value as obj1
obj1==obj2 # false statement
obj1!=obj2 # true statement
obj1==obj2 & obj1==obj3 # FALSE AND TRUE => FALSE
obj1==obj2 | obj1==obj3 # FALSE OR TRUE => TRUE

```

---

- We can also use logical operators in vectors.
- the AND and OR operators `&` and `|` are then applied element-wise.
```{r, eval=TRUE}
vec2=1:5 # defines vector vec2=(1,2,3,4,5)
vec2==3  # =FALSE if element is not 3, =TRUE if element is 3
vec2>=2&vec2<5 # Only TRUE for elements >=2 and <5
vec2>=2|vec2<5 # TRUE for all elements since either >=2 or <5
```

## Characters 
- Vectors can also store characters.
- characters are enclosed in `""`or `''`.
```{r, eval=TRUE,error=TRUE}
# define a vector of 2 cities
cities<-c('Maastricht', "Amsterdam",'Rotterdam')
print(cities)
# combine characters and numbers => numbers turn into characters
mix=c(1,"2")
print(mix)
# now that numbers are converted to characters, numerical operations
# produce an error
mix+1
```
## Names
- You can give the elements of your vector names either directly or using the `names()` command.
- This is very useful for accessing elements (see nect slide)
```{r, eval=TRUE,error=TRUE}
avg_temp<-c(Maastricht=14.2, Amsterdam=13.4,Rotterdam=13.7)
print(avg_temp) # names appear on top of elements
names(avg_temp) # returns names of elements
# Alternatively, we can define data and names separately
temp<-c(14.2,13.4,13.7)
names(temp)<-cities # recall that we have defined "cities" earlier!
print(temp)
```
## Accessing elements
- One can access the elements of a vector either by name or position.
```{r, eval=TRUE,error=TRUE}
# return the second element of "avg_temp" defined before
avg_temp[2] 
# return the element corresponding to "Maastricht"
avg_temp["Maastricht"]
# trying to access a non-existing element yields "NA"
# ( for "not available"), i.e. a missing value
avg_temp[4]
```

---


- We can also add elements to an existing vector.
```{r, eval=TRUE,error=TRUE}
# now add another city to avg_temp
avg_temp["Tilburg" ]<- 14.7
# now the fourth element is defined!
avg_temp[4]
```

## More on NA, NaN, Inf
- `NA` ("not available") indicates missing values. 
- Anything combined with `NA` yields `NA`.
- `NaN`("not a number") indicates the result of a mathematically  undefined operation.
```{r, eval=TRUE,error=TRUE}
#define another vector
vec3=c(-1.2,NA,0)
# combine avg_temp and vec3
vec4=c(avg_temp,vec3) 
# divide elements by 0; notice the different outcomes
vec4/0 
```

# Matrices {#matrices}
- We can create a matrix with `m` rows directly using `matrix(vector,nrow=m)`.

```{r, eval=TRUE,error=TRUE}
# create matrix with 3 rows; fill numbers by row
mat1<-matrix(1:12,nrow=3,byrow=TRUE)
mat1
```

---

- We can also combine vectors of the same length by row with `rbind(v1,v2,...)` or by column by `cbind(v1,v2,...)`.
```{r, eval=TRUE,error=TRUE}
# create vectors v1, v2 and v3 and combine them for same result
v1<-1:4
v2<-5:8
v3<-9:12
mat2=rbind(v1,v2,v3)
mat2
```


# Matrix indexing
- We can give the rows and columns names using `rownames()` and `colnames()`.
```{r, eval=TRUE,error=TRUE}
# assign names to columns
colnames(mat1)<-c("col1","col2","col3","col4")
mat1
# assign names to rows
rownames(mat1)<-c("row1","row2","row3")
mat1
```
## Accessing elements

- We can access single elements by `[rownumber,colnumber]`, the `k`-th row by `[k,]` and the `k`-th column by `[,k]`.
```{r, eval=TRUE,error=TRUE}
# get element in second row in third column
mat1[2,3]
# get second row
mat1[2,]
# get third column
mat1[,3]
```

---

- If rows/columns have names, we can also use those.
- Using vectors, we can also create more complicated subsets of matrices.
```{r, eval=TRUE,error=TRUE}
# get sub-matrix using vectors
mat1[c(2,3),c(1:3)]
# get second row using names (recall definition of mat2)
mat2["v2",]

```

## Exercise
1. Create the 3x3 identity matrix "by hand". To do so:
	a) create 3 vectors of with zeros and ones in the appropriate spots.
	b) use `rbind()` or `cbind()` to combine them into the identity matrix.
	c) store the identity matrix as the object "I_mat".
	d) R makes your life easy: type `diag(3)` in your console.

2. Replicate the following Excel-matrix:

# Matrix algebra
- R can do matrix "regular" algebra, and even lets you do operations that are not well-defined mathematically. 

- `t(A)`is the transpose of the matrix `A`.
```{r, eval=TRUE,error=TRUE}
# define matrix containing normal data
data.vec=rnorm(9,mean=0,sd=1)
A=matrix(data.vec,nrow=3) 
A # return A
t(A) # return the transpose
```

---

- `solve(A)` returns the inverse of an invertible matrix.
```{r, eval=TRUE,error=TRUE}
solve(A) # return the inverse of A
```

---

- `*`does element-wise multiplication.
- `%*%` does matrix multiplication .
```{r, eval=TRUE,error=TRUE}
# element-wise multiplication
A*solve(A) # NOT the identity matrix
# matrix multiplication
A%*%solve(A) # yields the identity (up to a small error due to the
# numerical computation of the inverse)
```


## Lists
- A `list` is a generic collection of objects.
- Unlike vectors, the components can have different types (e.g., numeric and character).
